In this work, we identify two key properties related to the contrastive loss: (1) alignment (closeness) of features from positive pairs, and (2) uniformity of the induced distribution of the (normalized) features on the hypersphere. We prove that, asymptotically, the contrastive loss optimizes these properties, and analyze their positive effects on downstream tasks. Empirically, we introduce an optimizable metric to quantify each property. Extensive experiments on standard vision and language datasets confirm the strong agreement between both metrics and downstream task performance. Directly optimizing for these two metrics leads to representations with comparable or better performance at downstream tasks than contrastive learning.} }

close to natural inputs but classified incorrectly. In order to better understand
the space of adversarial examples, we survey ten recent proposals that are designed
for detection and compare their efficacy. We show that all can be defeated by constructing
new loss functions. We conclude that adversarial examples are significantly harder
to detect than previously appreciated, and the properties believed to be intrinsic
to adversarial examples are in fact not. Finally, we propose several simple guidelines
for evaluating future proposed defenses.},
